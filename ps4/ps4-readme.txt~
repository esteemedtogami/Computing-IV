 *  DNA Sequence Alignment
 **********************************************************************/

Name: Sam Pickell
Login: spickell


Hours to complete assignment (optional): 16 hours and 32 minutes



/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain what you did to find the alignment itself.
 **********************************************************************/
 First you need to check if the place you're moving to in the matrix
 is a valid mathematical solution, and if it is, move to the cheapest
 location.


/**********************************************************************
 * Does your code work correctly with the endgaps7.txt test file? 
 * 
 * This example should require you to insert a gap at the beginning
 * of the Y string and the end of the X string.
 **********************************************************************/
Input: atattat
       tattata

Expected output: atattat-
                 -tattata

What happened:	 atattat-
                 -tattat-
			


/**********************************************************************
 *  How much main memory does your computer have? Typical answers
 *  are 2 GB to 16 GB.
 **********************************************************************/
 16 GB


/**********************************************************************
 *  For this question assume M=N. Look at your code and determine
 *  approximately how much memory it uses in bytes, as a function of 
 *  N. Give an answer of the form a * N^b for some constants a 
 *  and b, where b is an integer. Note chars are 2 bytes long, and 
 *  ints are 4 bytes long.
 *
 *  Provide a brief explanation.
 *
 *  What is the largest N that your program can handle if it is
 *  limited to 8GB (billion bytes) of memory?
 **********************************************************************/
a = 2
b = 4
largest N = 251

If I were limited to 8 GB of memory, 2 * 251^4 = 7938252002 (bytes). Any
larger N would be too large.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Were you able to run Valgrind's massif tool to verify that your
 *  implementation uses the expected amount of memory?
 *
 *  Answer yes, no, I didn't try, I tried and failed, or I used a 
 *  different tool.
 *
 *  If yes, paste in the ms_print top chart of memory use over time,
 *  and also indicate which file your code was solving.
 * 
 *  Explain if necessary.

a = 2

28284 is where I got the segmentation fault

 I worked with Jeff Ma on this assignment and got a little help with
