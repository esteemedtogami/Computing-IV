Creating sierpinski's triangle using C++ and SFML. This program utilized a recursive function which created smaller and smaller triangles that got stored in a vector and drawn when the recursion came to an end. I also created sierpinski's carpet as my original design, as this was a modified version of the triangle but created eight smaller squares. This assignment was rather difficult for me as I had a hard time following the code given in class and instead attempting to do it in a completely different way. I think the universal vector was useful as I struggled to implement the draw function directly in the recursive function.
