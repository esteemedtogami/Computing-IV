I tested my ring buffer implementation using the boost test functions provided
in the starter code as well as some boost tests that I wrote based on the
provided code (see the commented portions of test.cpp).

I implemented some basic exception handling in RingBuffer.cpp. Exceptions
are thrown if the capacity is set to something lower than 1, if the user
tries to enqueue a full queue, and if the user tries to dequeue or peek into
an empty queue.
